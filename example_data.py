So, all lecturers and all lectures have their own categories and we look at these categories. Then, there is a separate page, where we can find the lectures for the respective week on a list. Then we click on these lectures, we look at them and some lecturers upload their slides there. We can use those also. Otherwise, we do not have any exercises or so on Moodle, therefore I cannot say anything about them."}, {"id": "HD1-7402 Description", "number": 2, "text": "Okay, basically Moodle for me means that I have a list of courses. Now, this is getting a little abstract. So, a list of the faculties and on the side are my courses, and if I want to work with Moodle, that means, when I use Moodle for the first time, then I look up the course I want to have in the faculty and enroll there so to speak, when I have found the course, I enroll there and then I find my courses here on the side. Whenever I want to work with it in the respective course, I click on this specific course and in the end I more or less get to the semester schedule of my course, that lists the different weeks and with the weeks I find the respective materials and the discussion forum and the uploads I have to get. \n\nThat means, everyone can, well I know, Moodle has a chat function as well. There you go to discuss things or so. I had to do this yesterday, pretty annoying. That means Moodle enables me to exchange with the other students of my course, even if I am not present in the class, that means it does not matter if we have a semester in presence or online, as it works the same, as our assignments are the same, that means, it is like a virtual class actually."}, {"id": "HD1-7402 Explanation", "number": 3, "text": "Hey, basically, Moodle is an online platform, that means it is on the internet. See, we find it on the internet and for our different courses our lecturers can upload assignments or texts for the respective sessions and we can see them there, we can download them and work on the assignments there, and in discussion forums, we can exchange with other students. All these things, that means most courses are protected by passwords, i.e. only these people can take part that are registered in the course, unless you get the password from someone else. Then, you can also register. This, of course as decent students, we would never do, especially not with lectures or so."}, {"id": "HD1-7403 Description", "number": 4, "text": "When I think of Moodle, actually the first thing \u2013 I think of the typical view of the course. A typical website layout. At the top, I have the address bar. Then, somewhere on the website is the title of the course in the header. And then in the middle, I have my website content and on the left and right I again have two larger banners with several things on them. In the middle, I usually have a view in chronological order. So, it depends a bit, as this varies from course to course. It\u2019s a pity that there is no uniform setup. The chronologic view is sometimes in ascending or descending order. Sometimes not chronological. Here then there is such a list of headers which usually correlate with the lecture dates or the weeks of the course and below I have folders with any kind of materials, lecture slides for example. Here, I have the headers that correlate with the week and below that I have either hyperlinks or just ordinary links to folders that then contain further files. Sometimes, at the beginning of the page, the materials are directly linked to the file in the folder. But of this you cannot be sure. Therefore, you have to scroll up and down until you find something. I think one of the latest things they have added are these checkmarks there on the right, where you can kind of check and sometimes it is checked automatically somehow when you have downloaded the material. You don\u2019t know how this function works exactly. So, as I said, here I have a chronologic list of materials. At the beginning of the semester, all the weeks are listed already, but there is no material yet. I think this is rather helpful as you can clearly see that almost nothing is filled in yet and the material is still missing. So this is the main page and then I\u2018ll talk about these two side panels. A lot of stuff is in there. On the left, the things that refer to the user view, where sometimes you can navigate a little bit. On the left you may also have a framework of the whole course again, where you have kind of a quick access. Then there are evaluations, if you want to have the evaluation. I always found that important. Was hard to find, but this a good thing anyway. So then on the right side, if I remember correctly, I now have a calendar view where you can click. And then at the top, there is also this dicussion forum where you can click, which is linked. Then, I think that within this discussion forum you can open relatively many threads."}, {"id": "HD1-7403 Explanation", "number": 5, "text": "Well, I would say something like remember your school days, or your job training days and then I would make an analogy to some materials that you got then. Maybe your teachers handed out a piece of paper or so. And now that is for me, in my studies, for me it is in Moodle. There is a special website, an internet page, where I can go to and where I find information and the information is usually provided by my teachers, my lecturers, my professors. There I can get the materials that I need for my classes. Partly, I get more details about the lectures that were held but also certain assignments, i.e. work assignments that I have to fulfil in connection with the lectures. In addition, there is also the possibility to exchange with other participants or also the lecturers or professors, if there are any questions or problems, this is also a possibility, as if I would call someone or text these people. On this website I can do this."}, {"id": "HD1-7404 Description", "number": 6, "text": "So, I would somehow start from what I really see now, and that is somehow a kind of screen, where you see the Moodle website. Here, on the website you can log in. Then you can see some information. This is no longer exactly as it looked. Somehow this has been updated recently. That is like a user interface or what as computer scientists we call frontend. The whole thing can only be accessed via internet and therefore, I draw a cable, that means internet connection is there and then you somehow get to the server. There, the whole thing is probably a kind of a program. I guess that Moodle uses PHP, but I am not sure about that. So the software is divided into frontend software and backend software. I don\u2019t know the exact classification. Then I would add a third component  services, which is also part of the backend. Then, there is the next cable from server to database. Which basically is just a server as well. So, I guess, that there is not only one server, but several and the whole thing runs in parallel. So there is somhow redundance and security. With the database, it is the same. Maybe you could arrange everything on a larger scale by setting up areas. So one part is then more or less at home and the other at the data center."}, {"id": "HD1-7404 Explanation", "number": 7, "text": "Moodle is an online platform on the internet. If you don\u2019t know the internet very well, you can picture it like a kind of a television screen where you can see things. A page on which you can navigate yourself and then you can also log in yourself, which means you identify yourself. So, to show that it is you that is in there and not someone else. And then you get to an individual area and Moodle is there especially to exchange learning materials, that means here the teacher would make information available to you, just like in the past, sheets of paper were handed out, this is now done online. Of course you can then print it out if you want. So this is a way to distribute learning materials. Since there is no direct contact with the teacher, it is difficult to ask questions, therefore, there are these other functions, like a forum where you can ask questions. Then, the teacher can answer and you get feedback. You also have a calendar function where you can see for this course, I have my dates then and then new things will be uploaded, which you can then see. There is also a kind of register, where you not only can see your own courses, but at the university there are many faculties that offer courses and they are there for all. There you can choose what you would like to do and then you can enroll there. Also, just as you would have handed in your homework on paper at school, now, you can do so digitally. You can scan it and then load it up. So anyway, this is the site for the student or the pupil. In the same way, the teacher of course has the same possibility to manage these courses and to put these things online himself. You can then see what the student has done and give feedback. Just as for example you would get back your submission corrected, there it can be entered how many credits you got and which grade. So, basically everything you did in school, can now be rendered digitally."}, {"id": "HD1-7405 Description", "number": 8, "text": "So here I draw a kind of wireframe as you use it in the development of software prototypes to describe the interface. The biggest box that I draw is the browser. The bar up here is the browser bar where you enter the page. Then all this up here is browser and then down here, we now have Moodle. In my memory, I have a kind of main box here with the whole content. For example, the news on the startpage. Then on the right, you have a kind of sidebar, where you can select things. Here for example you get to your courses. Up here, I think there is another upper menu with a few buttons. I always click somewhere up here and get to my courses. Then the courses are shown here in such a list and then I choose the course, click on it, get in and can then see my pdfs.

So, suppose you are a lecturer and you want to make your slides available to the students and you do not want to use Dropbox for example, because this is not from the university, but instead a tool that is the same for all lectures. Where for example you only need one account. Then you use Moodle to upload your slides and for example also exercises for the students as well. In this context, the students can then also hand in their exercises. So, you have the possibility to upload an exercise that you did at home. In Moodle you also have a deadline that you have to observe, otherwise you can no longer upload. You can also give feedback. Also, in Moodle you can see all the courses that are available in the semester that are using Moodle. Well, these are not all courses. But it functions well for an overview. Suppose I would like to download the new slides, because I would like to print them, then I go to the Moodle page and log in, click on the course I want to have, look at the last entry there and download the respective file."}, {"id": "HD1-7406 Description", "number": 10, "text": "Here it says Heidelberg University or something like that in the header and here on the side, we have the navigation with the selected course at the top.

Usually this just corresponds to the weeks, what happens in which week. On the other side are messages or chats. Well, I have never written with anybody there, but the tutors send things. Here is the login or the profile. Then here, we have the link to the lecture, usually HeiConf. Then here, we have a discussion forum, an announcement forum and maybe a link to the script, and then week X-Y, week Y-Z, sheet X, deadline X, sheet Y, deadline Y.

Then the individual meetings, with the submissions and their materials respectively. On the start page, I also had my profile on the upper right, that means my account.

This is here the overview on the startpage and here the individual courses actually with their detailed view. There I usually navigate back and forth and look at the individual meetings.

So, first of course I have to log in, I have to register. This page is not open for everybody, not everybody can just enter.
