For example, Python strings are used to represent text-based data, and integers can represent whole numbers. When youâ€™re programming, you may want to convert values between different data types so you can work with them in different ways.

One common operation is to convert a Python string to an integer or an integer to a string. Python includes built-in methods that can be used to perform these conversions'''
